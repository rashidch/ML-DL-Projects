# ML DL PROJECTS

## 1. DL PROJECT

 - Image Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network
 - Dataset MNIST and CIFAR10
 - Showing correctly classified and miss classified Images
 - Displaying 9 feature maps per convolutional layer
 - Effect of L2 Regularization on overfittng and accuracy
## 2. DL PROJECT
- Building a recurrent neural network for character-level language
model
- Recurrent neural network (RNN) for word generation using character-level language model
- Long short term memory (LSTM) for word generation using charater-level language model 
- Shakespeare dataset
## 3. DL PROJECT
- Regression using Neural Network with 2 Hidden Layers from scratch
- Classification using Neural Network with one Hidden layer from scratch
